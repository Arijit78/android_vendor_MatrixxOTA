# Clean flash
For clean flashing: 
1. remove screen lock and sign in  before moving roms
2. flash [orangefox](https://orangefox.download/device/pong) if not installed
3. factory reset from orange fox 
4. adb sideload or copy rom to storage and flash, make sure to select flash ofox again after flashing rom if you don't want to loose ofox, if you get error while flashing check [#super_empty](https://t.me/DrishalDiscussion) note
5. reboot to recovery 
6. factory reset again (to be safe)
7. (OPTIONAL STEP) if using vanilla and want to flash gapps or microg, reboot to recovery before first boot and then sideload/flash your preferred gapps package 
8. now reboot to system and enjoy!

# Dirty flash
For dirty flash
just sideload/flash rom via recovery, make sure to reflash ofox if you don't want to loose it, and no need to format anything 
if you are using vanilla build, make sure to reflash the gapps/microg package if installed via recovery since it would get overridden after the dirty flash
